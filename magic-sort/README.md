# Magic Sort ‚Äî Analysis

## Game Mechanics

‚Ä¢ Core mechanic: Sort colored liquids by pouring them into bottles until each bottle contains only
one color.

a level.

bottles, and multi-step puzzles.

mistakes.

solving.

challenge growth.

‚Ä¢ Feature integration: New elements (hidden colors, locked bottles) are spaced out logically,
allowing time to adapt.

‚Ä¢ Consistency: Layouts remain visually clear; complexity grows through color combinations and
interactions rather than clutter.

**Conclusion**  

Magic Sort is simple to learn, and it manages to stay enjoyable as the levels become more challenging.
Daily Challenge and Journey are two strong features that give players reasons to return. Smooth
animations and bright colors make the experience pleasant, though some small adjustments could
make the game even better. The shop is the weakest part, since gold is only used for hints and lives,
which makes progress feel limited. The currency would feel more valuable if it could also be spent on
customization or small upgrades. With these improvements, the game could remain engaging for longer
and perform better in the long run.
